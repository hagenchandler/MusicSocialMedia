Ideas:
  - Need to look at Apple Music and Spotify API's
    * https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applemusicapi/
    * https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
  - Need to decide on a language and create a mockup.
    * I would like for it to not have a ui beyond an app icon that you click on that generates the playlist in the other streaming service.
    * Alternatively I would I could make it a versioning type system where there is a playlist that can be updated by other people.
  - Probably want to use Copilot to learn the technology.

  - Going with the name PlaylistVersioning for the project name.
  - ReactNative App in VSCode
    * I don't know if I can create an iPhone app on a windows machine which is a problem I need to figure out.


Spent most of the time today trying to figure out a path forward and creating Spotify and Apple Music developer accounts.
